Week 3 - Problem Maximum Profit
@author: Andr√© Gilbert, andre.gilbert.77110@gmail.com

Given an array, design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you can't sell a stock before you buy one and you are only permitted to complete at most one transaction.
'''

# input = [9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 3]
# output = 5
# Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 5 (price = 7), profit = 7 - 2 = 5

prices = [7, 4, 9, 10, 3, 8, 1, 6, 1, 2, 8, 1, 4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 5]
