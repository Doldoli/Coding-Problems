Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
Note that empty strings are considered valid.

# input = "Racecar"
# output = True
# forward: racecar = racecar :backward

# input = "Nice"
# output = False
# forward: nice != ecin :backward

string_1 = "Hello"
string_2 = "Race a car"
string_3 = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
