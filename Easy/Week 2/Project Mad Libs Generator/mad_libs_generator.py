Week 2 - Project Mad Libs Generator
@author: Andr√© Gilbert, andre.gilbert.77110@gmail.com

The Mad Libs Generator design is such that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs 
that will be considered as a Mad Lib. Mab lib is one of the python projects for beginners. 
The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, 
the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form.
